## Calculus
- The world calculus originates from the word pebble which were use to compute equations or account of stores of value

### What is a derivative? 
A derivative is the rate of change of a function at a certain point. Take for example a function of

$$
y = f(x)
$$

Then the change in y with respect to the change in x can be written as:

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)
$$


### Product, Quotient & Chain Rule
#### Product rule
- The product rule states that where we have the product of two functions i.e   
y = f(x)
y = g(x)

Then the change in Y with respect to changes in X can be calculated using the following rule.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)
$$

Which translates to the derivative of f(x) multiplied by g(x) + f(x) multiplied by the dervivative of g(x)


### The quotient rule
- The quotient rule acts as the invers of the product rule.
- It can be instantiated as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{f'(x) \cdot g(x) - f(x) \cdot g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}
$$





### Finance Application
In finance this refers to a contract that relates to the value of an underlying asset. An option is an example of a derivative because the value of the option is derived from the value of the underlying asset.
