## Calculus
The world calculus originates from the word pebble which were use to compute equations or account of stores of value. The term now generally refers to the study of change.

### What is a derivative? 
A derivative is the rate of change of a function at a certain point. Take for example a function of

$$
y = f(x)
$$

Then the change in y with respect to the change in x can be written as:

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)
$$


### What is a limit?
When calculating rate of change we calculate the rise over run. i.e the change of y vs change in x. In order to do this we need two points for Y and two points for X. But how do we do this at a specific point on a curve for example? Won't we only have on Y value and one X value?

Well thats where limits come in. In order to calculate the derivative we need to compute this between x and 0 where x is the limit. So in essence the limit is a tool to calculate a derivative.

### Some important Rules - Generalised Power, Product, Quotient & Chain Rules
### Generalised Power Rule
Take a function of:

$$
y = f(x)
$$
where 
$$
f(x) = x^3
$$

The generalised power rule states that the dervivative of this function at any value of X is equal to:

$$
f'(x) = 2x^2
$$ 

We can say - *'The derivative of f(x) - or f prime x is 2 x squared'*

#### Product rule
- The product rule states that where we have the product of two functions i.e   
y = f(x)
y = g(x)

Then the change in Y with respect to changes in X can be calculated using the following rule.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)
$$

Which means to the derivative of f(x) multiplied by g(x) plus f(x) multiplied by the dervivative of g(x)

### The quotient rule
- The quotient rule acts as the inverse of the product rule.
- It can be instantiated as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{f'(x) \cdot g(x) - f(x) \cdot g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}
$$

### Why are derivatives important in Finance?
Measuring how quick a variable changes with respect to another can determine how much risk we take in decision making over a set amount of time. Take the roulette table in a casino and a bet of red or black (ignoring the zero). As soon as the ball lands in a slot, the rate of change of our stake is 100%. We either lose all of our stake or we gain all of our stake. Hence why this game is high risk.

Take an alternative example of investing the S&P 500. In a practical scenario the probability of each of the 500 companies that make up the index losing all of their value in a very short amount of time is close to zero (unless an asteroid hit). Now the rate of change of the price with respect to time may be at rate of 1-3% per day. Meaning the price fluctuates by this amount in a 24 hour period, therefore we can state that this game is less risky than the roulette table pound for pound. 

This is why measuring the rate of change of something is central to finance. It helps predict risk and reward
