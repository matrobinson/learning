## Calculus

- The word *calculus* originates from the word *pebble*, which was used to compute equations or to account for stores of value.

### What is a derivative?

A derivative is the rate of change of a function at a certain point. For example, given a function:

\[
y = f(x)
\]

the derivative, often represented as \( f'(x) \) or \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), tells us how \( y \) changes with respect to \( x \).

### Product, Quotient, & Chain Rule

1. **Product Rule**: For functions \( u(x) \) and \( v(x) \),
   \[
   (u \cdot v)' = u'v + uv'
   \]

2. **Quotient Rule**: For functions \( u(x) \) and \( v(x) \),
   \[
   \left(\frac{u}{v}\right)' = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}
   \]

3. **Chain Rule**: For a composite function \( h(x) = f(g(x)) \),
   \[
   h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)
   \]

### Finance Application

In finance, a *derivative* refers to a contract whose value is derived from the value of an underlying asset. An option is an example of a derivative because its value is based on the value of the underlying asset.
