## Calculus
- The world calculus originates from the word pebble which were use to compute equations or account of stores of value

### What is a derivative? 
A derivative is the rate of change of a function at a certain point. Take for example a function of

$$
y = f(x)
$$

Then the change in y with respect to the change in x can be written as:

$$ 
\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)
$$

### Some important Rules - Generalised Power, Product, Quotient & Chain Rules
### Generalised Power Rule
Take a function of:

$$
y = f(x)
$$

$$
f(x) = x^3
$$

The generalised power rule states that the dervivative of the this function at any value of X is equal to:

$$
f'(x) = 2x^2
$$ 

'The derivative of f(x) - or f prime x

#### Product rule
- The product rule states that where we have the product of two functions i.e   
y = f(x)
y = g(x)

Then the change in Y with respect to changes in X can be calculated using the following rule.

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)
$$

Which means to the derivative of f(x) multiplied by g(x) plus f(x) multiplied by the dervivative of g(x)


### The quotient rule
- The quotient rule acts as the inverse of the product rule.
- It can be instantiated as:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{f'(x) \cdot g(x) - f(x) \cdot g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}
$$

### Why are derivatives important in Finance?
Measuring how quick a variable changes with respect to another can determine how much risk we take in decision making over a set amount of time. Take the roulette table in a casino and a bet of red or black (ignoring the zero). As soon as the ball is in play, the rate of change of our stake is 100%. We either lose all of our stake or we gain all of our stake. Hence why this game is high risk.

Take an alternative example of investing the S&P 500. In a practical scenario the probability of each of the 500 companies that make up the index losing all of their value in a very short amount of time is close to zero (unless an asteroid hit). Now the rate of change of the price with respect to time may be at rate of 1-3% per day. Meaning the price fluctuates by this amount in a 24 hour period, therefore we can state that this game is less risky than the roulette table pound for pound. 

This is why measuring the rate of change of something is central to finance.

### Finance Application
In finance this refers to a contract that relates to the value of an underlying asset. An option is an example of a derivative because the value of the option is derived from the value of the underlying asset.
