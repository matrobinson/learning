### Lists, Arrays, Stacks and Heaps

"The first rule of data structures is: You do not confuse lists, arrays, stacks, and heaps. The second rule of data structures is: You do not confuse lists, arrays, stacks, and heaps."

- Lists are like the soap we make—endlessly malleable, versatile, and built from elements we decide on as we go.
- Arrays are our fight club: ordered, compact, no wasted space, every member in a fixed position and ready for the next fight.
- Stacks are single-purpose machines—last in, first out. Like the secrets we bury but can’t keep away from long.
- Heaps? Heaps are the chaos we control, a pile of data, where the largest or smallest element bubbles to the top, keeping order just barely.

##"You decide your structure; you decide your data. That’s the freedom, and that’s the burden."
