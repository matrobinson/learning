### Important Wider Reading
- Attention is all you need
- Handwritten Digit Recognition with backpropogation
- An image is worth 16x16 words
- LoRA
- RAG for Knowledge intensive task

### Fundamentals
Machine learning is the process of a model learning behaviour from inputs and data and then extrpolating that behaviour on new data and information to provide an output.

- Regression - Defining pattern in the data. Think line of best fit through data points. Can we now apply that line to other data points we havent seen before
  - Logistic regression 
  - Linear regression

- Naive Bayes
- Neural Networks
- Decisions trees
- K Nearest neighbours
- Graident boosting
- Clustering 
- Random Forest
- CNN - Convolutional neural netowkrs



- Classification - Grouping elements/items/datapoints into speciifc categories, can we apply this model to other elements now


### Important Algos in Machine Learning
- Backprogation
- Gradient Descent


### Fundamentals of Neural Net
A neural network consists of a number of linked neurons into different layers. Each of these invidual neurons has an input an ouput and an 'activation' function in the middle that takes the input and computes the output.
